# Portfolio Squared

## Description

This portfolio project was developed with the aim of showcasing my skills, projects, and experiences in a professional and visually appealing manner. The motivation behind building this portfolio was to create a centralized platform where potential clients or employers could learn more about me and my work. It serves as a solution to the problem of effectively presenting one's portfolio online in a way that is engaging and informative. Throughout the development process, I learned valuable skills in React.js, UI design, and responsive web development.
